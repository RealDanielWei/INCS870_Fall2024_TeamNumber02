This repo contains the colab notebook workflows for using FT-Transformer to do network anomaly detection. We tested on two network security datasets: NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15.

To run them you need to upload your Kaggle json file at the first code block in order to download corresponding datasets.

Note: The actual implementation of the model would be pulled from another repo of mine: https://github.com/RealDanielWei/MLModels
